# ml_in_freshwater_management
### This repository holds the relevant files for AISC Freshwater Management: ((https://community.ai.science/ml-in-freshwater-management))

 This GitHub repository contains the instructional tools for a 12-week working group sponsored by NRCan. They are designed to guide participants through hands-on learning, offering practical resources and insights tailored to the programâ€™s objectives.
 
 + The 'Data' folder has the raw satellite readings for Canada's great nothern lakes, as well as the estimated error recordings for Lake Winnipeg. 
 
 + The 'winnipeg_error_raw' Jupyter Notebook file shows how to process the satellite readings to find the error in the measurements.  
 
 + The 'kf_numpy' and 'kf_numpy_2' Jupyter Notebook files are machine learning free means of building a Kalman Filter in python. 
 
 + The 'LSTM Kalman Filter' Jupyter Notebook file has a deep learning / Kalman Filter hybrid, trained on Lake Winnipeg's error estimations. 
 
  + The 'Pytorch Kalman Filter' Jupyter Notebook file has a deep learning / Kalman Filter hybrid, using Pytorch. An explanation of the intent of combining deep learning with Kalman Filters is given therein.
