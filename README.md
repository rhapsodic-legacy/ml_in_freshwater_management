 The notebooks herein were designed as instruction tools for use in the 12 week long working group sponsored by NRCan. As the group was relatively junior, multivariate time series and other more advanced topics were not intensively covered.
 
 + Linear Kalman Filter (cleaned data and raw versions): a linear kalmna filter that uses the mean of a given timestep's water levels as the input. 
 + A random forest regression -hybrid- Kalman Filter, that injects itself every X time steps to maintain filter confidence. This hybrid model's effectiveness is tied to the size of the amplitudes of error (& uncertainty). 
 + Student entries; several teams had ready a model during final presentations. Herein they rest, with authors attributed. 
 
 Each notebook is intended to demonstrate how to combine computer and the physical sciences to those in the group.
