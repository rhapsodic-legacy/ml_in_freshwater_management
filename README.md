#### This repository holds the relevant files for AISC Freshwater Management: ((https://community.ai.science/ml-in-freshwater-management))

 The notebooks herein were designed as instruction tools for use in the 12 week long working group sponsored by NRCan. 
 
 + The folder 'student entries' were the final projects of the students in the working group. 
 
 + The 'kf_numpy' Jupyter Notebook file is a machine learning free means of building a Kalman Filter. 
 
 
 + Linear Kalman Filter (cleaned data and raw versions): a linear kalmna filter that uses the mean of a given timestep's water levels as the input. 
 + A random forest regression -hybrid- Kalman Filter, that injects itself every X time steps to maintain filter confidence. This hybrid model's effectiveness is tied to the size of the amplitudes of error (& uncertainty). 
 + Student entries; several teams had ready a model during final presentations. Herein they rest, with authors attributed. 
 
 Each notebook is intended to demonstrate how to combine computer and the physical sciences to those in the group.
