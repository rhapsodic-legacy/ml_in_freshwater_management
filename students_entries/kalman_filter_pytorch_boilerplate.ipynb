The data is loaded from a CSV file, and the Kalman Filter model is trained using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error between the filtered output and the true output. The filtered output is then plotted against the true output using matplotlib."],"metadata":{"id":"3GlIGJ3prtat"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"drlvuMC7rfrC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677800183135,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":203,"user":{"displayName":"Dream Phoenix","userId":"09226332887600260845"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","# Define the Kalman Filter model\n","class KalmanFilter(torch.nn.Module):\n","    def __init__(self, n_dim_state, n_dim_observation):\n","        super(KalmanFilter, self).__init__()\n","        self.n_dim_state = n_dim_state\n","        self.n_dim_observation = n_dim_observation\n","        self.A = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.eye(self.n_dim_state))\n","        self.B = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.zeros((self.n_dim_state, 1)))\n","        self.C = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.zeros((self.n_dim_observation, self.n_dim_state)))\n","        self.Q = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.eye(self.n_dim_state))\n","        self.R = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.eye(self.n_dim_observation))\n","\n","        # Initialize the state and covariance matrix\n","        self.state = torch.zeros((self.n_dim_state, 1))\n","        self.P = torch.eye(self.n_dim_state)\n","\n","    def forward(self, u, y):\n","        # Predict\n","        x_hat_minus = self.A @ self.state + self.B @ u\n","        P_minus = self.A @ self.P @ self.A.T + self.Q\n","\n","        # Update\n","        K = P_minus @ self.C.T @ torch.inverse(self.C @ P_minus @ self.C.T + self.R)\n","        self.state = x_hat_minus + K @ (y - self.C @ x_hat_minus)\n","        self.P = (torch.eye(self.n_dim_state) - K @ self.C) @ P_minus\n","\n","        return self.state\n","\n","# Load the data from the CSV file\n","data = np.loadtxt('data.csv', delimiter=',')\n","\n","# Define the model parameters\n","n_dim_state = 1\n","n_dim_observation = 1\n","n_steps = data.shape[0]\n","\n","# Create the Kalman Filter model\n","model = KalmanFilter(n_dim_state, n_dim_observation)\n","\n","# Define the optimizer and loss function\n","optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n","loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()\n","\n","# Train the model\n","for i in range(n_steps):\n","    # Get the input and output data\n","    u = torch.Tensor([[data[i, 0]]]).T\n","    y = torch.Tensor([[data[i, 1]]]).T\n","\n","    # Predict the output using the Kalman Filter model\n","    y_pred = model(u, y)\n","\n","    # Compute the loss and update the model parameters\n","    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)\n","    optimizer.zero_grad()\n","    loss.backward()\n","    optimizer.step()\n","\n","# Plot the results\n","plt.plot(data[:, 1], 'k', label='True value')\n","plt.plot([model(u, y).item() for u, y in zip(torch.Tensor(data[:, 0]).unsqueeze(1), torch.Tensor(data[:, 1]).unsqueeze(1))], 'r', label='Filtered value')\n","plt.legend()\n","plt.show()\n"]}]}
